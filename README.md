# Advice generator app

## Overview
This advice app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Advice Slip API.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

I started with the HTML then styled with CSS. 
I then moved on to JavaScript functions and the API. 
### Built with


- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- API

### What I learned

This was my first time using an API. Writing the JavaScript functions to implement it was the most challenging part of this project.


### Continued development
I will continue working to improve my JavaScript skills. Also, APIs are fun! I'll continue working with them in future projects.
